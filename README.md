Hello, 

For this challenge, I broke down my objectives into different parts and focused on them accordingly.
I chose to go with Java/Maven/Tomcat, as they were the most recent tools I've worked with and was comfortable coding in for this timeed challenge.

Goal #1: To be able to read through a JSON file 

Goal #2: To output the JSON file on a webpage

Goal #3: Implementing a way change the output to tailor bilingualism 

Goal #4: Make the application accessible 

However, I was not able to reach my goals. At the top of each files, I wrote a comment explaining my thought process.
Hopefully, it helps you guys to understand what was going on in my mind.
